# blur
A small python package containing basic utilities for use in chance art

Currently in the middle of a major refactor to fix mistakes from long ago when this project was originally hacked together. Expect all kinds of breaking changes.

TODO:
* Heavily refactor code, correcting and cleaning up all kinds of mistakes
* Implement complete test coverage
* Start using some kind of version numbering system
* Place on PyPI?
* Add a folder of example usages
* Create extensive documentation
